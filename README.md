# .vimrc
Lightweight Vim runtime configuration.

## Setup
Almost everything is setup and downloaded automatically. Just run the following commands, and you will be good to go.

* `cd ~`
* `wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Joklost/.vimrc/master/.vimrc`
* `vim`

## Usage
The .vimrc will check for updates on GitHub when you launch vim, and it will let you know if an update is available.

Available commands:
* `:CheckUpdate`
  * Will check if a newer version is on GitHub.
* `:Update`
  * Will force an update.
